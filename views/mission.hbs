				<p class="card-title">What We Do</p>
				<p class="fam-card-description">We hold a mentorship program called <a href="/families">HogWATTs</a> for incoming EE students. We also have activites open to all general members including: <a href="/projects">tinkering workshops</a>, social atmosphere talks, and outreach (to other engineering majors and K - 12 students). Every workshop is beginner friendly and members will have the freedom for creativity. Members will learn basic circuits, career tips, and managing a healthy school life balance.</p>

				<p class="card-title">Learn about Women in Tech!</p>
				<p class="fam-card-description">“When you enter tech, you realize that there are more men than women. You can’t deny that. But, I don’t think you can make that an obstacle. You can’t get deterred as a female founder knowing that’s the landscape. You need to ignore the naysayers (of course there will be naysayers) and surround yourself with investors who believe in you, believe in your idea, believe in the market you’re going after, and believe in your ability to execute, most importantly.” - Rachel Tipograph, Founder and CEO of MikMak.TV</p>
